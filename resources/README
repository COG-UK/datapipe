Descriptions of the included resources:

- MN908947.fa
- MN908947.gb
  These are the reference genome fasta and genbank files, used to place genomes in reference coordinates for alignment/trimming steps
  and for typing variants specified relative to the reference.

- date_corrections.csv
  central_sample_id,sample_date
  These overwrite the dates in MAJORA

- resequencing_omissions.txt
  These IDs have been resequenced and should be omitted

- mask.txt
  start (1-based), mask character, regex-format string to match record.id
  Masks with a ? regions of the alignment that may be unreliable, currently only one base

- AAs.csv
  AAmutation, nuc position in reference
  Specific mutations to look for
- dels.csv
  nuc position in reference, length
  Specific deletions to look for

- geography
  Lookup tables to translate human coded adm0 adm1 adm2 regions to meaningful reports
