Descriptions of the included resources:

- MN908947.fa
- MN908947.gb
  These are the reference genome fasta and genbank files, used to place genomes in reference coordinates for alignment/trimming steps
  and for typing variants specified relative to the reference.

- date_corrections.csv
  central_sample_id,sample_date
  These overwrite the dates in MAJORA

- resequencing_omissions.txt
  These IDs have been resequenced and should be omitted

- AAs.csv
  AAmutation, nuc position in reference
  Specific mutations to look for
- dels.csv
  nuc position in reference, length
  Specific deletions to look for

- publish_recipes.json
  A file of recipes to make the billions of output files.
  Parsed by bin/publish_from_config.py
  Each key in the dict represents an outdir
  For that outdir, a list of outfiles is given, each represented by a dict
  Outfile dicts can include fields: suffix, data, fasta, metadata_fields, where, and mutations
  Either data in ["cog", "cog_global"] or fasta in ["unaligned", "aligned", "trimmed", "cog_global"] must be specified
  Mutations is a bool, metadata_fields a list and all others are strings
